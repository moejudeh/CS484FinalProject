## What does your application do?
It allows users to upload their articles of clothing and be able to select their outfit of the day. This outfit would then be shown to their friends that they have added and can react to one another outfits. This application would also have a calendar to show last time a piece of clothing/outfit was worn. It would also tell the user that they have not worn an outfit in a while.

## What makes it different than a CRUD app? I.e., what functionality does it provide that is not just a user interface layer on top of a database of user information,and the ability to view / add to / change that information?
It would allow people to make their own categories and allow people to add one another and see each other outfits.

## What security and privacy concerns do you expect you (as developers) or your users to have with this application?
making sure people do not get into other's accounts. Also, making sure that people arent able to see what is in another persons closet.

### This repository

This repository has a package.json that functions as a blank shell that gets full credit if you turn it in to the gradescope autograder. We will not be using the autograder in any way to actually evaluate your project, it is just there to keep track of your initial submission.

We recommend that you use this repository for your final project code. This will allow you to ask questions on Piazza and get help from the TAs and instructors. Adding a real linter, type checker, etc, based on our other examples would be a good idea.
