## What does your application do?
It allows users to upload their articles of clothing and be able to select their outfit of the day. This outfit would then be shown to their friends that they have added and can react to one another outfits. This application would also have a calendar to show last time a piece of clothing/outfit was worn. It would also tell the user that they have not worn an outfit in a while.
