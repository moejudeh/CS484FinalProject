## What does your application do?
a pictionary game that would be played like Kahoot in which a person would hold a lobby preferably on a computer or projector and others can join on their own devices. It then chooses a random person and they play Pictionary from either set categories or a group of custom categories set by the host. There will also be a homepage like Kahoot were people can upload their games and categories for other people to use and play with. The person drawing would do so on their device and it would show up on the main screen for everyone else to look at and guess using their own devices. It can be used for either helping students understand material better or just to have a fun time.

## What makes it different than a CRUD app? I.e., what functionality does it provide that is not just a user interface layer on top of a database of user information,and the ability to view / add to / change that information?
it allows people to connect to lobbies and be able to play in groups. It also allows other to look at their game information rather than it just being per user.

## What security and privacy concerns do you expect you (as developers) or your users to have with this application?
making sure people do not get into other's accounts. Also, people are not able to edit others' custom games.


### This repository

This repository has a package.json that functions as a blank shell that gets full credit if you turn it in to the gradescope autograder. We will not be using the autograder in any way to actually evaluate your project, it is just there to keep track of your initial submission.

We recommend that you use this repository for your final project code. This will allow you to ask questions on Piazza and get help from the TAs and instructors. Adding a real linter, type checker, etc, based on our other examples would be a good idea.
